# Canonical Documentation and Quarto Traceability

Date: 2026-03-30

## Purpose

This document is the canonical editorial ledger for the current project state. It consolidates:

- the live champion and active diagnostic layers;
- the ADSFCR adoption already implemented in this repository;
- the backlog that remains methodological only;
- the Quarto capítulos that must carry each claim;
- the primary references that should support those claims in the book;
- the legacy claims that should no longer be narrated as current state.

The book should use this document as an editorial source of truth together with live artifacts in `models/`, `data/processed/`, `reports/mrm/`, and `reports/run_comparisons/`.

## Final Closure Overlay (2026-04-05)

The repository now has an additional final closure layer that sits **on top of** the canonical monotonic base:

- canonical operational base: `canonical-monotonic-confirmatory-adsfcr-2026-03-30-1129`
- final paper/thesis promoted closure: `paper-thesis-final-economic-2026-04-06`

This overlay does not replace the canonical PD/governance stack. It replaces the old portfolio/paper narrative by adding:

- conformal reopen winner: `rank1_score_decile_raw_bins5_mgs100`
- `portfolio_bound_aware` progression: `5k -> 25k -> 276k`
- final promoted economic champion:
  - `risk_tolerance=0.175`
  - `policy_mode=blended_uncertainty`
  - `gamma=0.45`
  - `uncertainty_aversion=0.10`

Editorial source-of-truth for this closure:

- `models/final_project_promotion.json`
- `data/processed/final_project_summary.parquet`
- `models/champion_portfolio_policy.json`
- `models/champion_registry.json`

Conformal interpretation rule for the whole repo:

- **single final conformal winner**: `score_decile_mondrian`
- **necessary explanatory baseline**: `grade Mondrian`

`grade` remains necessary because it is the natural economic/regulatory partition that motivates Mondrian in credit. It should keep appearing in theory, diagnostics and governance prose. But it must no longer be narrated as a co-winner or as the final promoted conformal variant.

## Current Canonical State

### Champion and promotion state

- Current champion run tag: `canonical-monotonic-confirmatory-adsfcr-2026-03-30-1129`
- Champion family: CatBoost PD + Venn-Abers calibration + monotonic constraints in the promoted champion lane
- Operational fairness semantics: `outcome_mode=approval`
- Official decision threshold: `0.35`
- Internal PD screening/search threshold: `0.05`
- Promotion closeout: `reports/run_comparisons/canonical-monotonic-confirmatory-adsfcr-2026-03-30-1129/comparison.json`
- Registry source: `models/champion_registry.json`

### Final paper/thesis overlay

- Final promotion run tag: `paper-thesis-final-economic-2026-04-06`
- Promotion basis: `economic_champion_within_exact_robust_region`
- Robust region summary: `45/45` policies pass `alpha=0.01` exactly in the `276k` full-OOT mini-grid
- Economic comparator retained in docs only:
  - `0.175 / blended_uncertainty / gamma=0.45 / aversion=0.10`
- Balanced comparator retained in docs only:
  - `0.170 / blended_uncertainty / gamma=0.45 / aversion=0.10`

### Core live evidence

| Theme | Canonical artifact | Current read |
|---|---|---|
| PD champion | `data/processed/pipeline_summary.json` | `AUC=0.7127`, `Brier=0.1546`, `ECE=0.0067`, calibration `Venn-Abers` |
| Fairness | `models/fairness_audit_status.json` | `6/6` attributes pass; `approval` semantics; threshold `0.35` |
| Monotonicity | `models/monotonicity_audit_status.json` | `PASS`; `0` adjacent disruptions; `0` constrained-feature violations |
| Governance / C2ST | `models/governance_status.json` | overall governance `PASS`; C2ST remains severe but diagnostic |
| PD backtesting | `models/pd_backtesting_status.json` | statistical `diagnostic fail`, not a promotion rollback |
| Bootstrap validation | `models/bootstrap_validation_status.json` | diagnostic-only gap uncertainty layer for large-`N` calibration reading |
| PD interpretation | `models/pd_validation_interpretation_status.json` | `warning`; global gap small, but persistent quarter/cohort deviations |
| Calibration mapping | `models/calibration_mapping_status.json` | sidecar remap/intercept lane; does not overwrite canonical calibrator |
| IFRS9 diagnostics | `models/ifrs9_diagnostics_status.json` | `diagnostic fail`; recursive instability and weak near-unit-root power |
| Encoding stability | `models/encoding_stability_status.json` | `PASS`; no structural encoding/binning failures |
| Model-shift semantics | `models/model_shift_status.json` | distinguishes structural shift from predictive degradation |
| MRM wrapper | `reports/mrm/mrm_validation_report.json` | overall `PASS` with explicit diagnostic layers |

## Techniques Currently Active In The Project

The book should explicitly document the following as part of the live system, not as speculative add-ons:

| Venn-Abers calibration selection | Stronger probabilistic fidelity for downstream policy, IFRS9 and uncertainty | `data/processed/pipeline_summary.json`, `data/processed/model_comparison.json` | vigente |
| Mondrian conformal intervals | Group-conditional uncertainty for robust decisions and monitoring; `grade` is the natural baseline and `score_decile_mondrian` is the final promoted winner | `models/conformal_policy_status.json`, `models/conformal_gap/.../conformal_reopen_status.json` | vigente |
| Representativeness C2ST with drivers | Drift/representativeness diagnosis beyond PSI only | `models/governance_status.json` | vigente con warning |
| Monotonicity audit | Post-promotion defense of structural monotone behavior | `models/monotonicity_audit_status.json` | vigente |

| Bootstrap validation layer | Materiality-oriented uncertainty around aggregate and slice calibration gaps | `models/bootstrap_validation_status.json` | vigente |
| PD validation interpretation | Translate statistical failures into materiality-oriented language | `models/pd_validation_interpretation_status.json` | vigente con warning |
| Calibration mapping diagnostics | Shadow remap/intercept lane to test whether cohort persistence can be reduced without retraining | `models/calibration_mapping_status.json` | vigente |
| IFRS9 diagnostics | Stress-sign coherence, recursive stability, ADF power, scenario uncertainty | `models/ifrs9_diagnostics_status.json` | vigente con diagnostic fail |

| Model-shift and p-value interpretation | Separate structural representativeness shift from predictive degradation | `models/model_shift_status.json`, `models/governance_status.json` | vigente |
| Portfolio bound-aware final closure | Align theorem, funded set, and promoted policy on full OOT | `models/final_project_promotion.json`, `data/processed/final_project_summary.parquet` | vigente |

## ADSFCR Adoption Status

### Implemented from ADSFCR-inspired work

| ADSFCR family | What entered the repo | Live artifact | Implementation status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Representativeness via C2ST | classifier-based train/test representativeness with driver attribution | `models/governance_status.json` | implemented |
| Heterogeneity / monotonicity disruption | monotonicity structure audit for the promoted monotonic champion | `models/monotonicity_audit_status.json` | implemented |
| PD validation / backtesting | exact-binomial, Jeffreys-aware interpretation, HL/Z-style reading, material slice persistence | `models/pd_backtesting_status.json`, `models/pd_validation_interpretation_status.json` | implemented |
| Bootstrap hypothesis tests | bootstrap-based gap uncertainty for aggregate and slice calibration interpretation | `models/bootstrap_validation_status.json` | implemented |
| Calibration mapping diagnostics | intercept-shift and monotone remap sidecars on OOT windows | `models/calibration_mapping_status.json` | implemented |
| Calibration mapping shadow validation | consolidated wrapper to test whether a promising remap survives downstream Mondrian checks | `models/calibration_mapping_shadow_impact_status.json` | implemented and executed; closed as `keep_current_calibrator` |
| IFRS9 diagnostics | recursive regressions, ADF power, sign coherence, interval-width interpretation | `models/ifrs9_diagnostics_status.json` | implemented |
| Binning/encoding stability | WOE and bucket stability diagnostics | `models/encoding_stability_status.json` | implemented |
| Model-shift and p-value hardening | structural-vs-predictive shift semantics in governance and MRM | `models/model_shift_status.json`, `models/governance_status.json` | implemented |

### Still valuable but not implemented

| ADSFCR family | Why it remains interesting | Current decision |
|---|---|---|
| Blockwise / constrained threshold model design | Could inspire future challenger architectures or score-policy blends | methodological backlog |
| LGD survival / PoC calibration | Valuable for a future LGD/EAD lane hardening | backlog for LGD lane |
| LDP, Vasicek, concentration, EIR, repayment plans | Not central to the current Lending Club champion pipeline | do not integrate into core book narrative |

## Claim To Evidence Ledger

| Claim | Evidence artifact | Source type | Quarto location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `score_decile_mondrian` is the single final conformal winner, while `grade Mondrian` remains the necessary interpretable baseline | `models/final_project_promotion.json`, `models/champion_registry.json`, `models/conformal_gap/.../conformal_reopen_status.json` | internal canonical + derived promotion artifacts | `02c`, `07c`, `07d`, `14a`, `16a`, `16c` |
| The monotonic model is the current champion | `models/champion_registry.json`, `reports/run_comparisons/canonical-monotonic-confirmatory-adsfcr-2026-03-30-1129/comparison.json` | internal canonical artifact | `06d`, `10e`, `F` |
| The final paper/thesis portfolio champion is the economic champion inside the exact robust region, while theorem-tight remains a comparator | `models/final_project_promotion.json`, `data/processed/final_project_summary.parquet` | internal derived promotion artifact | `09`, `14c`, `14d`, `14e` |
| The 276k final closure revealed a full robust region instead of a single lucky point | `models/final_project_promotion.json`, `data/processed/portfolio_bound_aware/.../portfolio_bound_aware_bound_eval.parquet` | internal derived promotion artifact | `14d`, `14e` |
| Fairness is audited on approval decisions, not on raw PD exceedance | `models/fairness_audit_status.json`, `models/threshold_semantics.json` | internal canonical artifact | `06d`, `10e`, `10f` |
| The champion remains operationally valid despite some diagnostic warnings | `reports/mrm/mrm_validation_report.json` | internal canonical artifact | `01`, `10e`, `10f` |
| C2ST is intentionally diagnostic and should be interpreted with PSI/performance context | `models/governance_status.json` | internal canonical artifact + primary methodology | `10e`, `10f` |
| PD validation is not globally broken, but some cohorts deviate materially | `models/pd_validation_interpretation_status.json` | internal canonical artifact | `07d`, `10e`, `10f` |
| Bootstrap diagnostics add a large-`N` materiality lens on top of classical calibration tests | `models/bootstrap_validation_status.json` | internal canonical artifact + bootstrap testing references | `07d`, `10e`, `10f` |

| Calibration mapping shadow validation closed with no promotable remap candidate; the next PD work is analytical cohort interpretation, not a lightweight remap | `models/calibration_mapping_shadow_impact_status.json` | internal canonical artifact | `06d`, `07d`, `10e`, `10f` |
| IFRS9 currently needs stronger temporal defensibility | `models/ifrs9_diagnostics_status.json` | internal canonical artifact + primary time-series references | `10d`, `10e`, `10f` |
| Encoding/binning is structurally stable today | `models/encoding_stability_status.json` | internal canonical artifact | `05c`, `10e` |

## Legacy Claims That Must Not Be Narrated As Current State

| Legacy claim | Why it is now wrong or misleading | Editorial action |
|---|---|---|
| `grade Mondrian` and `score_decile_mondrian` are both “winners” | the project now distinguishes baseline interpretability from objective final promotion; only `score_decile_mondrian` is the final winner | rewrite |
| The monotonic challenger was useful but not promoted | the monotonic lane is now the promoted champion | rewrite everywhere |
| The canonical monotonic portfolio policy is also the final CRPTO champion | the final paper/thesis closure promotes a later economic policy on top of the canonical base | rewrite |
| The active champion run is `paper-grade-2026-03-13-final-heavy-...` or `champion-2026-03-12-mega-definitive` | those are historical milestones, not the current canonical champion | replace with current run tag or downgrade to historical context |
| Fairness semantics should be read on the old PD-threshold logic | current audit/search/policy semantics are approval-based | rewrite |
| C2ST should be described as a pure failure signal | in the current governance stack it is an informative/severe diagnostic with driver context | rewrite |
| IFRS9 sensitivity is dominated by PD | current diagnostic surface says `lgd_mult` dominates the sensitivity slope | rewrite |
| The book is structurally complete and only needs minor polishing | the project evolved materially after the earlier Quarto closure; multiple capítulos require live-state refresh | replace with maintenance reality |
| The final bound story is “conformal-only almost works” | the full story is monotonic base -> conformal reopen -> bound-aware region -> economic champion, with theorem-tight retained as comparator | rewrite |

## Internal Discovery Sources Used For This Refresh

These are discovery inputs only. They should not be cited in the book as scholarly references:

- `docs/ADSFCR_AUDIT_AND_MONOTONIC_CHALLENGER_PLAN_2026-03-29.md`
- `docs/MODEL_RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`
- `SESSION_STATE.md`
- `reports/mrm/mrm_validation_report.json`
- `.claude/projects/-home-eigenlinux-projects-Paper_CRPTO/memory/project_quarto_book_progress.md`
- `.claude/projects/-home-eigenlinux-projects-Paper_CRPTO/memory/project_mega_run_20260312.md`
- Codex thread registry metadata from `.codex/state_5.sqlite`

Use rule:

- discovery from chats and memory may suggest what changed;
- only repo artifacts and canonical docs may substantiate live claims;
- Quarto should cite primary literature plus canonical project artifacts.

## Primary Reference Targets For The Book

These references should anchor the methodology in Quarto:

- CatBoost and calibrated PD modeling
- fairness in supervised learning and threshold-based decision policies
- conformal prediction and adaptive conformal monitoring
- classifier two-sample tests for representativeness
- binomial interval / calibration backtesting interpretation
- recursive regression stability and unit-root testing
- SR 11-7 / model risk governance

## Editorial Defaults

- Narrate the current state, not the full promotion history.
- Keep historical promotions only when they help interpret why a technique exists.
- If a diagnostic layer is `warning` or `diagnostic fail`, explain it explicitly; do not hide it and do not escalate it into a false production failure.
- Prefer dynamic tables/figures sourced from canonical artifacts over hardcoded snapshots.
- Keep research lanes visible, but never present them as champion behavior when they are not part of the promoted stack.
