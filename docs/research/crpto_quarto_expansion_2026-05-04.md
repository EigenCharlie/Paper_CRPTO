# paper-crpto Quarto Expansion - 2026-05-04

This note records the book-side expansion added after the P1 hardening work. The
purpose is to keep the Quarto book richer than the eventual paper manuscript:
more explanation, more reviewer-facing context, and a local numeric reference
guide for the CRPTO section.

## Standalone Adaptation - 2026-05-12

This note has been adapted for the independent `Paper_CRPTO` repository. The
old monorepo chapter labels are no longer the source of truth; the standalone
book uses `01-introduccion.qmd` through `14-release.qmd` for the paper-ready
package and `15-fundamentos-riesgo-ml.qmd` through
`23-apendices-regulatorios-y-future-work.qmd` for the extended journal dossier.

The Quarto book is now the public companion surface through GitHub Pages. Local
renders remain useful for validation, but the public artifact is rebuilt by the
GitHub Actions `book-publish` workflow from the standalone repository.

## Book Changes

- Added `book/chapters/06b-guia-editorial-claims.qmd`.
- Added `book/chapters/06-blueprint-manuscrito.qmd`.
- Added `book/chapters/07-apendice-robustez.qmd`.
- Added the new pages to `book/_quarto.yml` under the paper-ready CRPTO part.
- Reworked the CRPTO landing page so it no longer depends on hard-coded
  chapter numbers and now explains how to read the book as an editorial dossier.
- Updated the introduction scope: the conditional Hoeffding/Bernstein tightening
  is now documented as appendix-level material, while Markov remains the main
  distribution-free theorem.
- Added a methodology table that maps every P1 evidence layer to its artifact and
  reviewer question.
- Linked the discussion back to the new editorial guide.
- Added a manuscript blueprint with target venue, abstract, claims C1--C7,
  paper outline, final table/figure plan, notation and claim-artifact-test
  location map.
- Added a journal appendix page that renders A12--A19 plus four new figures:
  CRPTO conceptual pipeline, alpha -> `Gamma_CP` -> funded set, and robust
  region heatmap.

## Journal Package Artifacts

The journal package is regenerated with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_crpto_journal_package.py
```

Generated tables:

- `crpto_tableA12_tail_risk_oce_cvar.csv`
- `crpto_tableA13_satisficing_margins.csv`
- `crpto_tableA14_dependency_cluster_diagnostics.csv`
- `crpto_tableA15_leave_one_period_stress.csv`
- `crpto_tableA16_bootstrap_funded_set_metrics.csv`
- `crpto_tableA17_budget_cap_lgd_sensitivity.csv`
- `crpto_tableA18_robust_region_policy_family.csv`

Generated figures:

- `reports/crpto/figures/crpto_fig12_crpto_conceptual_pipeline.png`
- `reports/crpto/figures/crpto_fig13_alpha_gamma_funded_set.png`
- `reports/crpto/figures/crpto_fig14_robust_region_heatmap.png`

Status artifact:

- `models/crpto_journal_package_status.json`

These outputs are diagnostics and manuscript-packaging evidence. They do not
replace `models/final_project_promotion.json` as the source of official champion
metrics.

## Why This Matters

The manuscript version should eventually be compressed, but the book should keep
the reasoning that justifies compression decisions. The new page separates:

- claims that belong in the paper body;
- robustness checks that belong in appendix;
- future work that should not be sold as current evidence;
- local numeric references `[1]`, `[2]`, ... for the CRPTO narrative.
- A12--A19 robustness evidence that can be pushed to appendix instead of
  crowding the paper body.

## Guardrails

The documentation tests should verify that:

- the new Quarto pages are registered in `book/_quarto.yml`;
- the page contains a claim ladder, reviewer Q&A, paper-placement table and local
  numbered references;
- the manuscript blueprint contains venue, claims C1--C7 and final table/figure
  plan;
- the appendix page references A12--A19 and the new figures;
- the CRPTO docs still point to the official economic champion and do
  not reopen the champion search.

## Quarto Practices Retained From The Parent Book

- Keep `execute.freeze` enabled so editorial renders do not silently recompute
  champion artifacts.
- Use a landing page with a compact whole-game explanation, route table and
  chapter cards, rather than a marketing-style hero page.
- Prefer callouts for scope, caveats and reviewer-facing warnings; keep theorem,
  artifact and table claims linked to reproducible paths.
- Preserve search, page navigation, repository actions and sidebar tools in
  `book/_quarto.yml` because reviewers need inspection paths. PDF remains an
  explicit local/release artifact until the Pages workflow builds it.
- Keep figure widths, table overflow and dark-mode styling explicit in
  `book/styles.scss` so GitHub Pages and local renders behave consistently.
- Do not bring Streamlit, dashboard, Paper 2 or research-lab navigation into the
  public CRPTO companion unless a future venue explicitly asks for it.
