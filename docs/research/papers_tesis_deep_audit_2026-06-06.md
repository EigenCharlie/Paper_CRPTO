# Papers_tesis Deep Audit - 2026-06-06

## Resumen ejecutivo

Esta auditoría cubre `61` PDFs locales en `Papers_tesis` y fue generada para el corte `2026-06-06` con `scripts/build_papers_tesis_deep_audit.py`.

La decisión central no cambia: **Paper CRPTO conserva el champion oficial** y la literatura nueva se usa para reforzar teoría, related work, appendices y límites de claim. La agenda extendida CRPTO/tesis absorbe el material que sí pertenece al laboratorio vivo: source/shift conformal, utility-directed conformal, tail risk, DFL, IFRS9 proxy, data/noise/equity y governance.

Regla aplicada: `book/references.bib` se modifica solo cuando una fuente queda citada o se prepara explícitamente para texto Quarto de Paper CRPTO/agenda extendida CRPTO/tesis. Las fuentes `needs_bib_if_cited` permanecen en la matriz sin inflar la bibliografía.

## Fronteras que permanecen falsas

- CRPTO no reclama legal fair lending con atributos protegidos directos.
- CRPTO no implementa IFRS9 contractual.
- agenda extendida CRPTO/tesis no reclama CATE policy value.
- agenda extendida CRPTO/tesis no reclama online deployment.
- agenda extendida CRPTO/tesis no reclama Bellman/DLA exacto.
- SPO+/DFL puede ganar regret, pero no reemplaza la garantía/auditabilidad CRPTO.

La auditoría agrega valor como integración bibliográfica y de claims. No crea un nuevo champion, no exige nuevas corridas y no transforma fuentes future-work en evidencia empírica del paper actual.
