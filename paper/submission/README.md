# IJDS Submission Package

This directory is the handoff checklist for the IJDS submission surfaces. The
source of truth remains:

- `paper/CRPTO_ijds.qmd` for the anonymous manuscript body.
- `paper/supplement_ijds.qmd` for the anonymous online supplement.

## Render Commands

```powershell
just paper-submission
just paper-submission-pdf
```

The HTML render is the writing preview. The PDF render is a local HTML-print
verification draft for pagination and visual inspection. The final submission
PDF should be produced with the official INFORMS IJDS LaTeX template and
double-anonymous review option (`dblanonrev`), not with a hand-written local
style.

## Official Template Sources

- INFORMS author portal: <https://pubsonline.informs.org/authorportal/latex-style-files>
- IJDS submission guidelines: <https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/ijds/submission-guidelines>
- Overleaf template page: <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-informs-journal-on-data-science/sbthszxgycfn>

Do not vendor private template downloads, reviewer forms, or authenticated
publisher material into this repository. Keep only public links and the
conversion notes needed to reproduce the submission package.

## Anonymity Checklist

- Manuscript metadata uses `author: "Anonymous"`.
- Supplement metadata uses `author: "Anonymous"`.
- Public GitHub, DVC, MLflow, DagsHub and personal URLs are described as a
  companion package but not exposed in the double-anonymous body.
- Title-page, acknowledgements and repository disclosure are kept for the cover
  letter or for post-acceptance policy, not the anonymous manuscript.
- Local paths, parent-project paths and usernames do not appear in the submitted
  sources.

## SPO+ Numbering Rule

Use the committed A19/Figure 15 artifact for body claims:

- Two-stage regret: `0.425896`
- SPO+ regret: `0.216837`
- Relative reduction: `49.09%`
- Wilcoxon: `p = 1.39e-164`

The PyEPO 1.3.7 closeout remains a curated appendix note:

- Two-stage regret: `0.358073`
- SPO+ regret: `0.184366`
- Relative reduction: `48.51%`
- Wilcoxon: `p = 3.80e-163`

These protocols are compatible but not interchangeable.

## Final Assembly Checklist

- Compress body text to the IJDS page budget after PDF pagination is available.
- Keep A3--A21 in the online supplement unless a reviewer-facing argument needs
  one compact table in the body.
- Preserve CRPTO as the coverage/auditability method and SPO+ as the low-regret
  comparator.
- Regenerate previews with `just paper-submission` before release.
- Run the repository gates: `just lint`, `just smoke`, `just validate-champion`.
